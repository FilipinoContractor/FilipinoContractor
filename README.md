- 👋 Hi, I’m @FilipinoContractor.
- 👀 I’m interested in connecting independent contractors from the Philippines with people in the US that need contractors to help them improve their lives or complete projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Laravel.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on knowledge and skill assessments.
- 📫 Reach me using the contact form on my website www.filipinocontractors.com. 
- 😄 I am an expert on employee and customer experience, but I have been coding since I had an Atari 400 in the early 1980's.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I was the Robotron 2084 World Champion - based on a competition held at Astroworld in Houston, Texas - but I think it was just a gimic by Williams to promote the game and eat people's quarters.
